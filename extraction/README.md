## CTAB solution:


|final concentration | amount for 500 mL          |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 100 mM Tris pH 8    |  50 mL |
| 1.4 M NaCl    |  140 mL of 5M |
| 20mM EDTA    |  20 mL |
| 2% CTAB    |  10 g |
| sterile H2O    | 280 mL  (or to 500 marker) |
|β-mercaptoethanol | 5 μl  |

## protocol: 
### lysis
1. warm the CTAB solution before use if it was refrigerated to get the detergent back into solution 
2. dissect the snail, separate tissue, and mince. resuspend tissue in 600μl CTAB solution 
3. add 15 μl of 20mg/ml Proteinase K (qiagen)
4. using a wide bore pipette, pipette up and down to homogenize the sample  
5. incubate @ 60C and 250 rpm overnight 
6. if tissue is still not dissolved in the morning, incubate @ 65C and 250 rpm for ~2 hours, inverting every 10 min
### chloroform reaction (do 3x)
7. working in the hood add 600μl Chloroform
8. mix by inversion until milky and continue to mix by gentle inversion for 15 minutes
9. spin for 10 min @ 13,000 rpm
10. carefully transfer ~0.5ml of the aqueous layer (top layer) to a fresh microcentrifuge tube (1.5ml) (be sure to avoid the fluffy layer at the interface between aqueous and organic layers)
### DNA precipication
11. add 1 ml cold Molecular biology grade ethanol (minimum 95%)
12. mix well by gentle inversion (if you have a lot of DNA you will see it come out of solution!!)
13. precipitate DNA by leaving in –80°C freezer for 40 min 
14. spin for 20 min @ 13,000 rpm / 16,627 rcf 
15. remove/discard supernatant by gentle pipetting
16. gently add 1000 ul of cold 70% ethanol to wash the pellet (do not mix, just dribble down tube)
17. air-dry the pellet (but do not let dry to completion): remove as much ethanol as possible by subjecting the tube to a quick
spin in the microcentrifuge and removing residual ethanol. Let sit open to the air for a few minutes.
18. resuspend pellet in TE buffer(200 μl) 

## RNAse A Treatment 
* add 10ul of RNAse A
* mix by inversion 
* incubate at 37C for ~1 hour (mix at 200rpm for samples with high concentrations)
* if contamination remains, incubate at 56C for ~10 min
